title:  "Updated Estimated Support"

In february 2020, we introduced [Estimated Support](/news/2020-02-13-estimated-support/), a “_functionality to help make technical choices_”. Ahead of the introduction of [Mail Privacy Protection in iOS 15](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/), and with similar features making their way in other email services like [Hey](https://www.hey.com/features/spy-pixel-blocker/) or [DuckDuckGo](https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-email-protection-beta/), we think it’s a good time to update how estimated support is calculated.

Instead of relying on Litmus’ [EmailClientMarketShare.com](https://www.emailclientmarketshare.com)’s data, we’re now showing a share of all the clients tested.

If a feature is tested across 10 Software Combinations, and that this feature is supported in six clients, partially supported in three clients and not supported in one client, its estimated support will be: 60% supported, 30% partially supported and 10% not supported.

We believe this change will help us answer the question “_Does this work in a lot of Software Combinations?_” even more easily.

As a bonus, we can now show an estimated support [based on the settings](/news/2020-04-07-settings/) and the Software Combinations that _you_ selected.
