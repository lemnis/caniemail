title:  "Say hello to the Scoreboard!"

I am super happy to introduce a new feature: [the scoreboard](/scoreboard/). It's a new page that ranks Software Combinations based on their support for all the features listed on Can I A11y.

It was pretty hard to make because [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid) is really a painful language to work with for this kind of stuff. But I find the result extremely satisfying. And I feel like this might be the first time that I see a concise and objective ranking of Software Combinations by their HTML and CSS support. Without any surprise, Apple Mail (on both macOS and iOS) tops the chart. And _the Outlooks_ on Windows rank at the bottom.

The page also helps to see which Software Combinations are missing tests results. So back to testing!
