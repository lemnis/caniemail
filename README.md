# Can I A11yâ€¦

[cania11y.com](https://www.cania11y.com) provides Software Combinations support tables for HTML and CSS features.

_Can I A11y_ runs on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) as [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages) site with a home made theme. The site uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for CSS compilation.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**.

git clone https://github.com/lemnis/cania11y.git
```

See [Cloning a repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) on GitHub documentation. If you're not familiar with Git or GitHub, I strongly encourage you to try [GitHub's desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) on macOS, Windows or Linux.

2. **Install Jekyll**.

```sh
gem install bundler jekyll
```

See [Jekyll Installation Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

You can turn on [incremental regeneration](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/incremental-regeneration/) with the `--incremental` flag.

```

The _embed_ version of the site ([embed.cania11y.com](https://embed.cania11y.com)) is built by specifiying the config file to use.
